\section{Deployment View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' uses of this view}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers can use this view to find out how they can deploy the website when it becomes bigger.
\end{itemize}

\section{Design Rationale}
\begin{itemize}
    \item New data operations should be added to fix and correct datas.
    \item Deployment should be seperated on two services, one for deploying the website and handling SQL database, one for updating pdf constantly. So if one of them crashes users can continue to get information by another.
\end{itemize}
