\chapter{Architectural Views for Suggestions to Improve the Existing System}

\section{Context View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' uses of this view}

There are three main stakeholders of the system: the volunteers, victims, developers. \\

The volunteers use this view to understand how they will help the victims by sharing information with website.
The victims use this view to understand how they can get help to get food, healthcare, etc.
The developers use this view to understand how they can build a bridge between victims and volunteers and how they can achieve to forward the validated information as fast as possible.

\section{Functional View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' use of this view}

There are three main stakeholders of the system: the volunteers, victims and developers. \\

The volunteers use this view to find locations which can help to go there or donating money.
The victims especially use this view to make use of Google Maps API since it is very helpful to find all crucial locations in a compact form near them.

\section{Deployment View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' uses of this view}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Developers can use this view to find out how they can deploy the website when it becomes bigger.

\section{Design Rationale}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Live location services can help to improve the link between victims and volunteers.
    \item Mobile application may help to reach more victims and volunteers.
    \item New data operations should be added to fix and correct datas.
    \item Deployment should be seperated on two services, one for deploying the website and handling SQL database, one for updating pdf constantly. So if one of them crashes users can continue to get information by another.
\end{itemize}
