\chapter{Architectural Views for Suggestions to Improve the Existing System}

\section{Context View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' uses of this view}

There are three main stakeholders of the system: the volunteers, victims, developers. \\

The volunteers use this view to understand how they will help the victims by sharing information with website.
The victims use this view to understand how they can get help to get food, healthcare, etc.
The developers use this view to understand how they can build a bridge between victims and volunteers and how they can achieve to forward the validated information as fast as possible.

\section{Functional View}

\subsection{Stakeholders' use of this view}

There are three main stakeholders of the system: the volunteers, victims and developers. \\

The volunteers use this view to find locations which can help to go there or donating money.
The victims especially use this view to make use of Google Maps API since it is very helpful to find all crucial locations in a compact form near them.
The developers use this view to add new functionalities to this system so that they can reach more people and help to faster delivery of aid.
